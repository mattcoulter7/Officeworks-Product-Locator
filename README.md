# Officeworks Product Locator
https://youtu.be/ns4UfY0n5uY
This was one of the first applications I ever made, back in High School.
Simple UI Interface showing a map of an Officeworks Store, and a product selection that reveals the path to find the product when selected.
No route finding, just hardcoded paths!!

## How to run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio and press Run Solution
